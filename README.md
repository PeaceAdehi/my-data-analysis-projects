# My Data Analysis Portfolio
Welcome to my  personal collection of data analysis projects, showcasing my learning journey and practical application of data skills.

These projects reflect my growing ability to clean, analyse, and visualize data to extract insights.

# Skills & Tools
SQL: Data cleaning, calculated fields, joins, exploratory analysis
Python: Data scraping(Requests, BeautifulSoup), data wrangling, visualization(Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Predictive Modeling Tools: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (regression, classification, model evaluation), Statsmodels 
Excel: Lookup functions, formulas, charts, pivot tables,  Data cleaning, conditional formatting,  dashboards
Tableau: Interactive dashboards, calculated fields and bins, joins
Power BI: Dynamic reports and  dashboards
