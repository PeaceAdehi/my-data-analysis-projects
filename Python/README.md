# Python Projects Portfolio

This repository contains  a collection of beginner to intermediate level Python projects that demonstrate data cleaning, exploration, visualisation, web scraping,  and fundational programming concepts like loops and functions.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Requests & BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Projects Overview

### 1. BMI Calculator 
- A simple program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using user input.
Focused on foundational Python concepts: **variables**, **input/output**, and **conditional logic**.

---

### 2. Loops and Functions Practice
- Practiced **`for`** and **`while`** loops, **functions**, and **if-else statements**.
- Built reusable functions and explored different use cases with small projects.

### 3. Data Cleaning Project
- Cleaned and transformed raw customer data using **Pandas**.
- Key Tasks:
  - Trimmed unnecessary whitespace and characters from text
  - Standardized inconsistent **phone nmber formats**
  - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., Do_not_use_column)
  - Split address columns into structured parts: **Street**, **City**, **Zip Code**

### 4. World Population Data Analysis
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a global population dataset.
- Tasks & Insights:
  - Sorted data by population and growth rate
  - Grouped by **continent**
  - Visualised population distribution using:
   - **Heatmaps**
   - **Line Plots**
- Transposed tables and used pivot-style views for better comparism

### 5. Web Scraping - Wikipedia
- Scraped structured data from a real Wikipedia page using:
  - **Requests**
  - **BeautifulSoup**
- Extracted specific tables and cleaned them for further analysis or export.

 ## Summary
 These projects demonstrste a wide range of Python skill from basic programming concepts like loops and functions to real world applications such as data cleaning, analysis, and web scraping. They reflect my strong foundation in data handling using Pandas, visualisation with Matplotlib and Seaborn, abnd working with external data sources. Collectively, these projects showcase practical, hands-on experience relevant to data analysis, automation, and entry-level data science roles.
