## Projects Overview

### 1. BMI Calculator 
- A simple program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using user input.
Focused on foundational Python concepts: **variables**, **input/output**, and **conditional logic**.

---

### 2. Loops and Functions Practice
- Practiced **`for`** and **`while`** loops, **functions**, and **if-else statements**.
- Built reusable functions and explored different use cases with small projects.

### 3. Data Cleaning Project
- Cleaned and transformed raw customer data using **Pandas**.
- Key Tasks:
  - Trimmed unnecessary whitespace and characters from text
  - Standardized inconsistent **phone nmber formats**
  - Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., Do_not_use_column)
  - Split address columns into structured parts: **Street**, **City**, **Zip Code**

### 4. World Population Data Analysis
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a global population dataset.
- Tasks & Insights:
  - Sorted data by population and growth rate
  - Grouped by **continent**
  - Visualised population distribution using:
   - **Heatmaps**
   - **Line Plots**
- Transposed tables and used pivot-style views for better comparism

### 5. Web Scraping - Wikipedia
- Scraped structured data from a real Wikipedia page using:
  - **Requests**
  - **BeautifulSoup**
- Extracted specific tables and cleaned them for further analysis or export.

### 6. Predictive Modeling – Employee Retention & Churn Prediction
- Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer with a global workforce of over 100,000 employees. The company operates at the intersection of alternative energy and automotive innovation, producing electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles.

Following a recent employee survey, senior leadership requested ***a data-driven approach to improving employee retention***.

- Objective:
 Analyze employee survey data and build a predictive model to identify factors influencing employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

- Approach & Methods:
 - Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis on HR survey data
 - Analyzed key features such as: Department, Number of projects, Average monthly, working hours, Job satisfaction and tenure, Built a regression model to predict employee churn, Evaluated model performance, and interpreted key predictors.

Key Outcomes
 -Identified workload, project count, and job satisfaction as major drivers of attrition
 -Provided actionable, data-backed recommendations to support retention strategies
 -Demonstrated the use of predictive analytics to solve a real-world HR business problem

- Skills Demonstrated
-Business-focused data analysis
-Predictive modeling with Python
-Translating analytical results into actionable insights

 ## Summary
 These projects demonstrste a wide range of Python skill from basic programming concepts like loops and functions to real world applications such as data cleaning, analysis, web scraping, and predictive modelling. They reflect my strong foundation in data handling using Pandas, visualisation with Matplotlib and Seaborn, abnd working with external data sources. Collectively, these projects showcase practical, hands-on experience relevant to data analysis, automation, and entry-level data science roles.
